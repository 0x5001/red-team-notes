### AV Bypass
- We can use "DefenderCheck.exe" to learn what part of a binary is getting detected by windows defenders.
- We can change strings in detected payloads to bypass AV.
- We can compress executable.
- We can use Obfuscation tools to obfuscate all binaries.

### Payload Delivery
- We can use NetLoader to deliver our binary payloads.
- It can be used to load binary from filepath or URL and patch AMSI & ETW while executing.
