# Introduction to EDR
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system protects individual devices (endpoints) by continously monitoring for and responding to security threats.
- It includes features for threat detection, incident response, investigation, and forensics making it a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategies.
- Most EDRs correlate activity to gain broader telemetry and improve on detections.
- Even if all performed activity is undetected by an AV, EDRs can still correlate all actions performed to identify attacker TTPs.
- EDRs are using mostly behaviour based detection.
### MDE
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
- MDE collects and processes behavioral signals from the OS and analyzes this using cloud security analytics, in addition to standard EDR capabilities.
- MDE also supports detections based on the following technologies:
    - Attack Surface Reduction rules, Exploit protection, Network protection, Controlled Folder Access and Device control.
